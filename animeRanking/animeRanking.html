                        <h2>Your Lie in April</h2>
                        <p>Really great and emotional series about a prodigy pianist, who ever since his mother's death has been unable to find the spark with the piano he once had. However, his life begins to change when he meets a violinst. Would really reccomend for those who like classical music or are just looking for a more thoughtful series.</p>

                        <h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
                        <p>Absolute banger of an anime. Giant human-eating titans, slicing and dicing, intense soundtrack, actually good and coherent plot, and non-stop action. If you love the action genre or just want to feel adrenaline pumped right into your body, I reccomend this anime for sure.</p>
